# 3D Game Engine

## 📌 Overview
This is a **simple 3D game engine** designed for showcasing **memory management, graphics programming**, and efficient system design. It is built using **C++17** and leverages modern libraries such as **GLFW, GLEW, SDL2, ImGui, Bullet Physics, and spdlog**.

## 🎯 Features
- **Core Engine**: Handles application lifecycle and event management.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation and deallocation with `MemoryManager`.
- **Job System**: Multi-threaded task execution with `JobSystem`.
- **Renderer**: OpenGL-based rendering pipeline.
- **Physics**: Uses Bullet Physics for realistic object interactions.
- **File System**: Handles asset loading and file I/O operations.
- **Logging System**: Uses `spdlog` for structured logging.
